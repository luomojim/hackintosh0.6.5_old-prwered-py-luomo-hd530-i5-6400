This is my hackintosh Opencore EFI(i5-6400 Gigabyte GA-B150M-DS3Hb150m)
This EFI file has been tested by myself and can run under the 11.2 version of MacOS（Big sur）. Because I will need to take a large exam in the future, I need to prepare for it. Therefore, the OC version will not be updated in the next few months. Thank you for your understanding!
